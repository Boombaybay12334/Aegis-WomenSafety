# Filebase Integration - Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the Filebase integration is working correctly.

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Flight Checks

### Backend Setup
- [ ] AWS SDK installed (`npm list aws-sdk` shows version)
- [ ] `backend/services/filebaseService.js` exists
- [ ] `backend/.env.example` has Filebase section
- [ ] `backend/.env` created from example

### Frontend Setup
- [ ] `evidenceService.js` updated (upload flow changed)
- [ ] `blockchainService.js` accepts CID and S3 parameters

### Documentation
- [ ] `FILEBASE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` exists
- [ ] `QUICK_SETUP_FILEBASE.md` exists
- [ ] `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` exists
- [ ] `README.md` updated with Filebase info

---

## üß™ Functional Tests

### Test 1: Mock Mode (No Credentials)
**Purpose**: Verify system works without Filebase configured

- [ ] Remove/comment out Filebase credentials in `.env`
- [ ] Start backend: `cd backend && npm start`
- [ ] Look for log: `‚ö†Ô∏è [Filebase] Credentials not configured, using mock mode`
- [ ] Upload evidence through frontend
- [ ] Check backend logs for: `üîß [Filebase] Using mock mode - no real upload`
- [ ] Verify evidence uploads successfully
- [ ] Check MongoDB for evidence with mock CID
- [ ] **Expected**: Mock CID like `bafybei...` (deterministic hash)

### Test 2: Real Mode (With Credentials)
**Purpose**: Verify actual Filebase integration works

**Setup:**
- [ ] Sign up at https://filebase.com/
- [ ] Create bucket named `aegis-evidence` with IPFS storage
- [ ] Get Access Key and Secret Key
- [ ] Add to `backend/.env`:
  ```env
  FILEBASE_ACCESS_KEY=FB...
  FILEBASE_SECRET_KEY=...
  FILEBASE_BUCKET=aegis-evidence
  FILEBASE_ENDPOINT=https://s3.filebase.com
  ```

**Test:**
- [ ] Restart backend: `cd backend && npm start`
- [ ] Look for log: `‚úÖ [Filebase] Filebase configured`
- [ ] Upload evidence through frontend
- [ ] Check backend logs for:
  - [ ] `üì§ [Filebase] Uploading to bucket: aegis-evidence`
  - [ ] `‚úÖ [Filebase] Upload successful: evidence/0x.../...`
  - [ ] `üîó [Filebase] Retrieved IPFS CID: bafybei...`
  - [ ] `üì¶ [Evidence] Root S3 Key: evidence/0x.../...`
- [ ] Verify evidence uploads successfully
- [ ] Check response contains real CID and S3 key

### Test 3: Filebase Dashboard Verification
**Purpose**: Verify files actually uploaded to Filebase

- [ ] Go to https://console.filebase.com/
- [ ] Log in to your account
- [ ] Click on `aegis-evidence` bucket
- [ ] Navigate to `evidence/` folder
- [ ] See wallet address folders
- [ ] See evidence ID folders
- [ ] See encrypted files with timestamps
- [ ] Click on a file to view metadata
- [ ] Verify IPFS CID is shown
- [ ] **Expected**: Files visible in bucket, CID displayed

### Test 4: Blockchain Anchoring with Real CID
**Purpose**: Verify blockchain gets real CID and S3 key

- [ ] Upload evidence (with Filebase configured)
- [ ] Check frontend console logs:
  - [ ] `üì§ [Evidence] Uploading to backend (Filebase storage)...`
  - [ ] `üîó CID: bafybei...`
  - [ ] `üì¶ S3 Key: evidence/0x.../...`
  - [ ] `‚õìÔ∏è [Evidence] Starting blockchain anchoring with real CID and S3 key...`
  - [ ] `‚úÖ [Evidence] Blockchain anchoring successful`
- [ ] Check backend logs for blockchain transaction
- [ ] Verify transaction on blockchain explorer
- [ ] **Expected**: Real CID and S3 key in blockchain transaction

### Test 5: Evidence Retrieval
**Purpose**: Verify evidence can be retrieved correctly

- [ ] Upload evidence
- [ ] Get evidence list: GET `/api/v1/evidence/list/{walletAddress}`
- [ ] Verify response includes:
  - [ ] `blockchain.cidRoot` (real CID)
  - [ ] `blockchain.s3KeyRoot` (real S3 key)
- [ ] Get specific evidence: GET `/api/v1/evidence/{evidenceId}`
- [ ] Verify each file has:
  - [ ] `s3Key` (real S3 path)
  - [ ] `cid` (real IPFS CID)
  - [ ] No `encryptedData` field (or null)
- [ ] **Expected**: Evidence retrieved with real storage references

### Test 6: Backward Compatibility
**Purpose**: Verify old evidence still works

- [ ] If you have old evidence (with `encryptedData`):
  - [ ] Retrieve old evidence via API
  - [ ] Verify `encryptedData` field is still present
  - [ ] Verify decryption works
- [ ] Upload new evidence (with Filebase)
- [ ] Retrieve both old and new evidence
- [ ] **Expected**: Both formats work correctly

## üêõ Troubleshooting Tests

### Issue: "Filebase not configured" but credentials are set
**Debug Steps:**
- [ ] Check `.env` file has correct format (no quotes around values)
- [ ] Verify no extra spaces in credentials
- [ ] Check `FILEBASE_ACCESS_KEY` and `FILEBASE_SECRET_KEY` are set
- [ ] Restart backend server
- [ ] Check logs on startup

### Issue: "Access Denied" from Filebase
**Debug Steps:**
- [ ] Verify Access Key is correct (starts with `FB` or similar)
- [ ] Verify Secret Key is correct
- [ ] Check bucket exists in Filebase dashboard
- [ ] Check bucket name matches `.env` exactly
- [ ] Verify bucket is set to IPFS storage

### Issue: "CID not available"
**Debug Steps:**
- [ ] Check Filebase dashboard - does file exist?
- [ ] Wait 2-3 seconds and retry (IPFS pinning takes time)
- [ ] Check bucket is configured for IPFS (not Storj/Sia)
- [ ] Check backend logs for retry attempts
- [ ] If persistent, check Filebase status page

### Issue: Upload works but no CID in response
**Debug Steps:**
- [ ] Check backend logs for Filebase upload
- [ ] Verify `cidRoot` and `s3KeyRoot` in response
- [ ] Check MongoDB record for blockchain fields
- [ ] Verify Filebase service returned CID
- [ ] Check if running in mock mode

---

## üìä Performance Tests

### Upload Speed Test
- [ ] Upload 1 small file (<1MB)
  - Expected: < 2 seconds
- [ ] Upload 1 large file (5-10MB)
  - Expected: < 10 seconds
- [ ] Upload 5 files at once
  - Expected: < 15 seconds
- [ ] Compare with mock mode
  - Mock should be faster (no network)

### Storage Verification
- [ ] Check MongoDB document size (should be small)
- [ ] Verify files not in `encryptedData` field
- [ ] Check Filebase dashboard for file sizes
- [ ] Verify total storage usage in Filebase

---

## üîí Security Tests

### Encryption Verification
- [ ] Upload evidence
- [ ] Check Filebase dashboard
- [ ] Download file from Filebase (if possible)
- [ ] Verify file is encrypted (looks like random data)
- [ ] Verify cannot decrypt without passphrase
- [ ] **Expected**: Files stored encrypted, unreadable

### CID Immutability
- [ ] Upload evidence
- [ ] Note the CID
- [ ] Upload same file again
- [ ] Verify different CID (different encryption)
- [ ] **Expected**: Each upload has unique CID

### Blockchain Verification
- [ ] Upload evidence
- [ ] Get transaction hash from logs
- [ ] Check blockchain explorer
- [ ] Verify CID is in transaction data
- [ ] Verify S3 key is in transaction data
- [ ] **Expected**: Real references on-chain

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

### Code Quality
- [ ] No errors in VS Code
- [ ] `npm start` runs without errors (backend)
- [ ] `npm run dev` runs without errors (frontend)
- [ ] No console errors in browser

### Documentation
- [ ] README.md updated
- [ ] Integration guide complete
- [ ] Quick setup guide clear
- [ ] Changes summary accurate

### Deployment Readiness
- [ ] `.env.example` has all required fields
- [ ] `.env` not committed to git
- [ ] Filebase credentials secure
- [ ] Mock mode works as fallback
- [ ] Error handling in place
