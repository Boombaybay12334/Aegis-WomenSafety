  - `viewEvidence()` - Decrypt and display evidence files
  - `deleteEvidence()` - Mark evidence as deleted
- **Security:** Prompts for passphrase, reconstructs master key from Shard A + Shard B

#### ‚úÖ **3. Updated UploadEvidence.jsx**
- **Replaced:** Mock `handleSubmit` with real `uploadEvidence()` call
- **Enhanced:** Better error handling and user feedback
- **Features:** Shows evidence ID on successful upload, 5-second timeout for ID visibility

#### ‚úÖ **4. Enhanced apiService.js**
- **Added:** `getShardForEncryption()` - Get Shard B for file encryption
- **Added:** `uploadEvidenceMetadata()` - Send encrypted files to backend
- **Added:** `getEvidenceListAPI()` - Retrieve evidence list from backend
- **Added:** `getEvidenceAPI()` - Get specific evidence with encrypted data

### Backend Implementation

#### ‚úÖ **5. Evidence Model (NEW FILE: models/Evidence.js)**
- **Schema:** Complete evidence storage with encrypted file data
- **Features:**
  - Stores encrypted base64 file data in MongoDB
  - File metadata (name, type, size, timestamp)
  - Steganography support (cover image tracking)
  - User ownership validation
  - Soft delete functionality
- **Security:** Only stores encrypted data, includes validation helpers

#### ‚úÖ **6. Evidence Routes (NEW FILE: routes/evidence.js)**
- **POST /upload** - Store encrypted files in MongoDB
- **GET /list/:walletAddress** - Return evidence metadata (no encrypted data)
- **GET /:evidenceId** - Return specific evidence with encrypted files
- **DELETE /:evidenceId** - Mark evidence as deleted (soft delete)
- **GET /stats/summary** - Anonymized statistics
- **Security:** Input validation, ownership verification, rate limiting

#### ‚úÖ **7. Enhanced Account Routes**
- **Added:** `POST /get-shard` - Return Shard B for evidence encryption
- **Security:** Lightweight version of recovery, returns only Shard B

## üö® **PRIORITY 2: SOS System** ‚úÖ

### Frontend Implementation

#### ‚úÖ **8. SOS Service (NEW FILE: sosService.js)**
- **Created:** Complete emergency alert system
- **Features:**
  - `sendEmergencySOS()` - Manual emergency alerts with location
  - `triggerDeadManSwitch()` - Automatic SOS after inactivity
  - `getSOSHistory()` - Retrieve user's SOS event history
  - `getCurrentLocation()` - Enhanced geolocation with error handling
  - `testSOSSystem()` - Development testing functionality
- **Authorities:** NCW, Police, Women's Helpline integration (simulated)

#### ‚úÖ **9. Updated EmergencySOS.jsx**
- **Replaced:** Mock `handleSendSOS` with real `sendEmergencySOS()` call
- **Enhanced:** Better location handling using `getCurrentLocation()`
- **Features:** Shows SOS ID, detailed authority notification, improved error messages

#### ‚úÖ **10. Updated deadManSwitch.js**
- **Replaced:** Mock `triggerAutomaticSOS` with real `triggerDeadManSwitch()` call
- **Enhanced:** Async/await pattern with proper error handling
- **Features:** Shows SOS ID, detailed failure fallback instructions

### Backend Implementation

#### ‚úÖ **11. SOS Model (NEW FILE: models/SOS.js)**
- **Schema:** Complete emergency event tracking
- **Features:**
  - Manual and automatic SOS types
  - Location data with validation
  - Authority notification tracking
  - Response and resolution tracking
  - Evidence linking for emergency access
- **Analytics:** Emergency statistics and monitoring

#### ‚úÖ **12. Emergency Routes (NEW FILE: routes/emergency.js)**
- **POST /sos** - Manual emergency alerts
- **POST /dead-man-switch** - Automatic SOS triggers
- **GET /history/:walletAddress** - User's SOS event history
- **GET /stats/summary** - Emergency system statistics
- **GET /active** - Active alerts for emergency services
- **POST /acknowledge/:sosId** - Mark alerts as acknowledged
- **Security:** Authority simulation, evidence linking, comprehensive logging

#### ‚úÖ **13. Updated Server Configuration**
- **Added:** Evidence and emergency route mounting
- **Updated:** Startup banner to reflect Phase 1 capabilities
- **Enhanced:** Endpoint documentation with categorized API list

## üîê **Security Architecture Maintained**

### Zero-Knowledge Principles ‚úÖ
- **Backend NEVER receives:** Passphrases, Shard A, master keys, or decrypted data
- **Client-side encryption:** All files encrypted before leaving the frontend
- **Shard separation:** Backend stores only Shard B references, client manages Shard A

### Data Flow Examples

#### Evidence Upload Flow:
```
1. User selects files ‚Üí Frontend prompts for passphrase
2. Frontend decrypts Shard A from localStorage
3. Frontend requests Shard B from backend
4. Frontend reconstructs master key (Shard A + Shard B)
5. Frontend encrypts each file with master key
6. Frontend sends encrypted base64 data to backend
7. Backend stores encrypted data in MongoDB
8. Master key cleared from memory
```

#### SOS Alert Flow:
```
1. User triggers SOS ‚Üí Frontend gets location
2. Frontend sends alert data to backend
3. Backend creates SOS record in MongoDB
4. Backend links user's evidence for emergency access
5. Backend simulates authority notifications
6. Frontend shows confirmation with SOS ID
```
